tcp-analyse
===========

look at some tcp connections

This is early days, so I do not recommend you look at this as yet.

The idea eventually is to compute some interesting properties of tcp connections,
with a view towards trouble-shooting.

The language is haskell.

We use the pcap library, and network-data.
